You should organize all the pages in a good structure.
You should be using a <div> to layout your pages.(Remember the Box Model, add padding and alignment to your overall page)

The use of CSS or scripts developed by others is ONLY allowed if you have modified it to fit your website. Copying is not allowed, and you will automatically get a zero if such action is detected.
The use of JQUERY is encouraged but not mandated.

Submission
Students will meet with me prior to the submission of the project. I will give pointers and critique for final product. I will ask a few question about the HTML, CSS & JavaScript code you wrote, so if you copied something from another website without understanding how it works, you'll get caught very easily.
